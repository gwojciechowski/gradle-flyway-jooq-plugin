gradle-jooq-flyway-plugin
==================

# Overview
[Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) plugin that help with integration of [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org) and [Flyway](http://www.flywaydb.org)
plugins, improving Gradle uptodate check on jOOQ task by adding check of currently applied Flyway scripts.
For each jOOQ task, the plugin adds dependency to Flyway by checking wheather database schema has changed or not since last code generation. 
If you rely on Flyway to manage database changes and using jOOQ same time - this plugin will ensure that jOOQ will regenerate your classes every time 
you changed the database with Flyway.  

# Plugin

## General
The flywayJooq plugin relies on two great plugins: [flyway-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/flyway/flyway) by boxfuse 
and [gradle-jooq-plugin](https://github.com/etiennestuder/gradle-jooq-plugin) by Etienne Studer. 
When both of them are applied flywayJooq adds an extra dependency to the jOOQ task that checks if there are any differences in applied scripts.

The plugin is hosted at [Bintray's JCenter](https://bintray.com/wstrzalka/gradle-plugins/gradle-flyway-jooq-plugin).

## Gradle 1.x and 2.0
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'pl.codelabs:gradle-flyway-jooq-plugin:1.3.1'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'pl.codelabs.flywayJooq'
```

## Gradle 2.1 and higher
```
plugins {
  id 'pl.codelabs.flywayJooq' version '1.3.1'
}
```

# Tasks
For each jOOQ configuration declared in the build, the plugin adds dependency to :flywayJooqInfoFile task that dumps out list of applied scripts into a file.
the format of the file is identical to flywayInfo (as it's generated by Flyway utils) with the difference only scripts applied to database are there.

```console
>gradle generateSampleJooqSchemaSource
:flywayJooqInfoFile                                                                  
Dumping flyway info to build\tmp\flywayJooqInfoFile\flywayJooq.info                                                              
:generateSampleJooqSchemaSource UP-TO-DATE      
               
BUILD SUCCESSFUL

>gradle flywayMigrate 
:flywayJooqInfoFile
